## What is This, and why is it Open Source?

StarDive is a project I worked on in 2015/2016 when I was 16. It's a fun game that I'm happy about creating. I haven't kept up on the App Stores or the newer Unity versions, so it is not currently public. 
If anyone wants to create a Pull Request that makes it so this program runs with newer versions of Unity, then I will re-release this game.


As for reasons why it is open source, well, that is because I think the time and effort for this game would be more beneficial to people if they can view it and edit it.

Here's a video of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gTI_Dlsh8g
